.. attention:: **If you installed** phyluce_ **using** conda_, the following
   section is unecessary for running your first data analysis.

phyluce_ is configured using the same system that conda_ uses to setup and
maintain is `.condarc` file.  Specifically, you use the `phyluce config` option
to update a YAML-formatted file at `~/.condarc`.  Although we provide the
`phyluce config` option as a helper, you can also edit this file by hand,
provided that you maintain correct YAML structure.
