The CLI_ interface of phyluce_ draws heavily from the conda_ Python_ package.
This is simply because the conda_ package is excellent, and it's user interface
seeks to solve many of the same problems the phyluce_ interface does - namely
running many different types of logically grouped commands in the same way.
**Thank you** to the conda_ developers.
